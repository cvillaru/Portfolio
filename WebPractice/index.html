                    Hi my name is Carlo. A simple dude living life like the next person. Born In Philippines, raised 
                    in Bristol by Asian parents. I like playing all sorts of games, from table-top games to 
                    computer games, but my favourite type of games are computer games; more specifically shooter 
                    games on a console or PC. I like learning new things like history, psychology and technology. 
                    I also like exercising, I go to gym three times a week and do some Kickboxing on the side twice 
                    a week. I also like travelling either solo or with my mates. I've been places like Baarcelona, 
                    Amsterdam, Santorini and more.

                        My interest for software development began when I was in year 7 when I was shown Scratch in I.T
                        class. This was an appliction that allowed users to create 2D games or animations and was my 
                        first introduction into programming. Instead of writing lines of code it used blocks; which were 
                        basically variables and commands that could be dragged-and-dropped together to create functions 
                        or methods. This made it easy for first time programmers how programming worked, but in a very 
                        simplfied way.
