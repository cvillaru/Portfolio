                                            Hi my name is Carlo. A simple dude living life like the next person. Born In Philippines, raised 
                                            in Bristol by Asian parents. I like playing all sorts of games, from table-top games to 
                                            computer games, but my favourite type of games are computer games; more specifically shooter 
                                            games on a console or PC. I like learning new things like history, psychology and technology. 
                                            I also like exercising, I go to gym three times a week and do some Kickboxing on the side twice 
                                            a week. I also like travelling either solo or with my mates. I've been places like Baarcelona, 
                                            Amsterdam, Santorini and more.

                                        My interest for software development began when I was in year 7 when I was shown Scratch in I.T
                                        class. This was an appliction that allowed users to create 2D games or animations and was my 
                                        first introduction into programming. Instead of writing lines of code it used blocks; which were 
                                        basically variables and commands that could be dragged-and-dropped together to create functions 
                                        or methods. This made it easy for first time programmers how programming worked, but in a very 
                                        simplfied way.

                                    Later in my secondary school years I was introduced to Python, which was also my first
                                    programming language. I enjoyed learning how to use this as I could see  what I made, 
                                    just by wrting a few lines of code. Those few lines turned into a few hundred lines of code 
                                    in 6th Form, still using Python as that was what was used in the subject I was studying.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                            <div class="title">Bad News But Good News</div>

                                <p>
                                    When exams came for the end of 1st year 6th Form came around, I unfortunately fare well; meaning, 
                                    I didn't get the grades I needed to carry on into 2nd year 6th Form. So I decided to leave and go to 
                                    college instead. There I would study for an I.T course for a diploma, and in that course I was 
                                    introduced to software development. This was when my passion for coding and programming truly began. 
                                    In my years in college I learnt prgramming languages such as HTML, CSS, XML and C#. With these 
                                    languages I ended up learning how to make applictions and websites. Obviously, these were neither 
                                    great looking or the most optimised apps or websites, but with the skills and knowledge I had then, 
                                    I was very proud of the things I made.

                                    I carried on my software development studies in university via Computer Science. The course gave
                                    a variety of subjects I had to study for such as Cryptography and Biocomputation. Both fun and 
                                    interesting to learn, but struggled to stranslate the new informtion to code. One subject I 
                                    enjoyed the most however was in my 4th year in university called Enterprise System Development
                                    (ESD). This subject was about learning how applications were made on an business/enterprise
                                    level. This was where i got most of my software development knowledge and skill. In this class I 
                                    got back to using python but this time had got to learn how to use REACT.js. One of the 
                                    assignements was to create a application for a made-up cinima company; not going to get into too 
                                    much details, but the jist was that, a team of 5 would create a booking system that would allow 
                                    customers to book seats for one or more people for a movie, have employees with specific amount 
                                    of control over the system and customers, and have the admin with the most amount of contol over 
                                    the system, other employees and customers.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Though this was a fun assignment me and my team didn't get to finish the product on time,
                                    therefore had to present with a system still full of bugs. Dispite this low moment, me and my team 
                                    passed the class, as the assignmet was graded by the amount of work the individual in that team
                                    contributed to building the system, as well as the amount of objectives we managed to complete; 
                                    I was lucky enough to have a team which all members participated in and completed enough objectives
                                    allowing us to pass the class.

                                    I graduate from university with 2:1, quit my previous job working in a warehouse (which I did
                                    not enjoy doing, but appreciated it), a month or so later found my current job as a
                                    Document Technician.

                                The goal for this website is to simply be able to practice and improve
                                my HTML and CSS skills, implementing anything I learn. This includes
                                the shadow effects on the side of this white background, how 
                                the sidebar opens and closes and the parallax effect which
                                introduced you to my webpage.

                                I expect to add more cool elememts on here such as pictures, more CSS
                                to get different effects, etc. But for now this is whaat I've got :)
