                            Later in my secondary school years I was introduced to Python, which was also my first
                            programming language. I enjoyed learning how to use this as I could see  what I made, 
                            just by wrting a few lines of code. Those few lines turned into a few hundred lines of code 
                            in 6th Form, still using Python as that was what was used in the subject I was studying.

                            When exams came for the end of 1st year 6th Form came around, I unfortunately fare well; meaning, 
                            I didn't get the grades I needed to carry on into 2nd year 6th Form. So I decided to leave and go to 
                            college instead. There I would study for an I.T course for a diploma, and in that course I was 
                            introduced to software development. This was when my passion for coding and programming truly began. 
                            In my years in college I learnt prgramming languages such as HTML, CSS, XML and C#. With these 
                            languages I ended up learning how to make applictions and websites. Obviously, these were neither 
                            great looking or the most optimised apps or websites, but with the skills and knowledge I had then, 
                            I was very proud of the things I made.
